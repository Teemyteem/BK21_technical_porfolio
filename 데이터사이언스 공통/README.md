## Stock Price Prediction by Using Long Short-Term Memory Model With Multiple Look Back Periods  
- Objective: Proposed a developed closing price prediction model by using three stocks from the Thai SET50 index (CPALL, AOT, LH).  
- Background:   
	- The stock market has long been a favorite among investors.  
	- To increase their profits, many investors would like to be able to anticipate stock prices, but this is challenging given the uncertain movement of stock prices.  
- Data:   
	- Collecting 2 date range data from the yfinance library  
	- CPALL stock (CP ALL PUBLIC COMPANY LIMITED)   
	- AOT stock (AIRPORTS OF THAILAND PUBLIC COMPANY LIMITED)  
	- LH stock (LAND AND HOUSES PUBLIC COMPANY LIMITED)  
  
- Model: CNN, LSTM  
- Result:   
	- In general, the results showed that LSTM outperformed CNN with high-performance
