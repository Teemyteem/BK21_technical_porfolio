## 1. 데이터마이닝 (Stroke)  
- Objective: To predict whether a patient is likely to get stroke based on the input parameters like gender, age, various diseases, and smoking status.  
- Data:   
	- 11 attributes, 1 stroke class, 5110 records  
	- Numerical variable (4): id, age, avg_glucose_level, bmi  
	- Categorical variable (7): gender, hypertension, heart_disease, ever_married, work_type, Residence_type, smoking_status  
	- Stroke class: 0 = No stroke, 1 = Stroke

- Preprocessing part:
  - Data visualization: Histrogram, box plot, scatter plot, line plot
- Model: Decision Tree, Color Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Naive Bayes, K-NN  
- Result:   
	- Decision tree: accuracy = 0.917  
	- Logistic regression: accuracy = 0.929  
	- Random Forest: accuracy = 0.928  
	- Gradient Boosting: accuracy = 0.929  
	- Naive Bayes: accuracy = 0.872  
	- K-NN: accuracy = 0.928
